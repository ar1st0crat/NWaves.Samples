Each subject was tested at an azimuth of -80 to 80 deg azimuth and an elevation of -45 to 231 deg.

Channel 1-50 of each .wav file corespond to this elevation matrix [-45 -39 -34 -28 -23 -17 -11 -6 0 6 11 17 23 28 34 39 45 51 56 62 68 73 79 84 90 96 101 107 113 118 124 129 135 141 146 152 158 163 169 174 180 186 191 197 203 208 214 219 225 231] 

Each subject has 25 .wav files (one for each azimuth and ear) that consist of 50 channels that represent the 200 tap impulse response at -45 to 231 deg elevation

The wavfile is named XXazYY.wav Where YY is either "left" or "right" to indicate the ear used and XX is the azimuth with the prefix neg to indicate a negative azimuth.

EX: the second channel of neg50azright.wav coresponds to the response at -50 deg azimuth and -39 deg elevation for the right ear. 

Note: 0 deg azimuth and 0 deg elevation coresponds to directly infront of the subject at ear level.  Positive evelation coresponds to moving up and positive azimuth coresponds to moving right.

Note: This database containes only impulse responses in .wav format instead of the matlab format.  To acess other aspects of the database such as ear photos please download the
